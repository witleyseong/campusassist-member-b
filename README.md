# CampusAssist – University Student Support System

Academic Java project developed as part of a university group assignment.

## Project Context
This project was developed in **2024** for a second-year university assessment.  
The goal was to design and implement a **console-based student support system** using Java and Object-Oriented Programming principles.

The system allows students and administrators to manage support appointments, feedback, and system data through a structured menu-driven interface.

## My Role – Member B
This was a **group project**, and my responsibility was **Member B**, focusing on the **admin-side functionality** and overall system management.

My main contributions included:
- Admin features and workflows
- Appointment management logic
- Feedback review and management
- Console-based application flow
- Supporting integration between modules
- Applying OOP principles and separation of concerns

---

## Key Features
- Java console-based application
- Maven **multi-module** project structure
- Role-based logic (student vs admin)
- Appointment management
- Feedback handling
- Modular and maintainable architecture
- Clear separation of responsibilities across modules

---

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Maven (multi-module project)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Console-based UI

---

## Project Structure
- `campusassist-main` – Application entry point
- `groupmembera` – Student-side functionality
- `groupmemberb` – Admin-side functionality (**my contribution**)
- `groupmemberc` – Additional system features

---

## Notes
This project was developed for **academic purposes** to demonstrate:
- Java programming skills
- OOP design
- Modular project architecture
- Team-based software development

It is not intended as a production system, but as a proof of technical foundations and structured problem-solving.
